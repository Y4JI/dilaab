                <h2>From Setbacks to Stages</h2>
                <p>Trent Vance wasn't born a motivational speaker. His journey was forged in the fires of adversity. After a successful career in corporate finance, a sudden and unexpected turn of events left him at a crossroads, questioning everything he thought he knew about success and purpose.</p>
                <p>It was in this period of deep reflection that he discovered his true calling: to use his story of resilience to empower others. He learned that our greatest challenges are often our greatest opportunities for growth. Today, Trent has shared his message with thousands across the globe, from Fortune 500 companies to non-profit organizations, inspiring them to turn their excuses into progress.</p>
